## Leslie matrix example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}

insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0), 
                        nrow = 3, 
                        ncol = 3, 
                        byrow = TRUE)

insect_leslie

```

```{r}
# Initial Condition
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)

```

```{r}
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

insect_y1
```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and year 3.

```{r}
insect_y2 <- (insect_leslie) %*% insect_y1

insect_y2

insect_y3 <- (insect_leslie) %*% insect_y2

insect_y3
```
